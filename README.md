# American sign language alphabet classification

## Team: Oliver-Erik Suik, JÃ¼rgen Leppsalu, Robert Allik
Our goal is to learn new machine learning tools and concepts by training different models with American sign language alphabet images.
We use these models for classifying hand signs from live video using OpenCV. We want to help non-ASL speakers understand ASL speakers by using computer vision.

### Classification:
For classification we are using the following models: FastAi, EfficientNet, Keras Sequential

### Object-detection:
For object-detection we built a custom Python script that predicts the hand-signs using OpenCV and our classification models.
